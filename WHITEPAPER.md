Abstract
The Sigil Protocol (.sg1) is an open-source, Rust-based framework for regenerative data representation, combining chaotic mathematics, post-quantum cryptography, and self-verifying structures to create portable, verifiable, and self-healing digital objects. It extends beyond traditional file formats by treating data as dynamic blueprints that can regenerate from partial or corrupted states, detect entropy drift, and enforce granular access controls. Recent advancements integrate universal constants (e.g., π and the golden ratio φ) for deterministic anchoring, Fibonacci sequences for efficient residual encoding, and Reed-Solomon parity for QR-like error correction. Paired with the Regent framework for distributed chunk management, Sigil enables ransomware-resilient data lakes, secure transfers, and decentralized distribution—without central servers or fragile backups. As an AGPL-3.0 licensed project, Sigil promotes community-driven innovation, ensuring data autonomy in high-stakes environments like healthcare, finance, and forensics.
1. Introduction
In today's threat landscape, ransomware attacks compromise data lakes and backups, encrypting critical assets and demanding ransom for decryption keys. Traditional solutions—hash-based verification, ACLs, and monolithic archives—offer limited resilience, often failing under partial corruption or key compromise. The Sigil Protocol addresses this by redefining data as regenerable, entropy-aware objects. Files, folders, and drives become cryptographically linked graphs where entropy, structure, and identity are captured at every level.
Built in Rust for safety and performance, Sigil leverages open-source tools (e.g., reed-solomon for parity, pqcrypto-kyber for quantum-safe keys) to ensure transparency. It draws on mathematical innovations: chaotic maps anchored by π for reproducibility, Fibonacci self-similarity for compression residuals, and vector-like parametric equations for "creating" data from formulas. This creates a system where data isn't just stored—it's alive, self-healing, and verifiable across distributed environments.
Sigil's evolution from a simple file format to a recursive object graph makes it ideal for data lakes, where ransomware recovery requires rapid, offline reconstruction without trusting compromised systems.
2. Core Concepts
2.1 Sigil File (.sg1) A .sg1 blueprint includes:
Magic header (SIG1) and version.
Entropy fingerprint (Shannon entropy per chunk) and chaos residuals.
ChaosRegen compression (exclusive, seeded by π/φ for determinism).
Regent chunk map with Merkle tree for verification.
Access control manifest (time/place/manner policies).
Post-quantum signatures (Kyber/Dilithium).
Optional encryption per segment.
2.2 Regent Framework Regent shards data into independent, verifiable chunks:
Each chunk has entropy scores, hashes, and parity.
Supports parallel validation (rayon integration).
Enables recursive graphing: Files shard folders, folders shard drives.
2.3 Recursive Object Graphing Data forms a distributed graph:
Chunks reference siblings via Merkle roots.
Regeneration uses cross-entropy from related .sg1 objects.
Fibonacci encoding for residuals ensures efficient, self-similar recovery.
2.4 Regeneration & Deduplication
Probabilistic reconstruction from partial graphs.
Deduplicate via shared entropy blocks across objects.
Vector-like creation: Fit data to parametric equations (Bezier with φ ratios) for generative unfold.
2.5 Resilience Modes
Glyph: Lightweight entropy + signature.
Reflection: Adds Reed-Solomon parity for 20-30% loss tolerance.
Seal: Full redundancy with quantum-safe ratcheting for high-integrity (e.g., cold storage).
3. Access Control & Identity
Multi-signature unlock (Dilithium for quantum safety).
Granular policies: Time (expiration), place (geofencing/IP), manner (read-only/audit-required).
Role-based workflows (e.g., doctor-access for patient files).
Expiry and TTL flags.
Audit trails: Merkle-logged access/edit history, tamper-evident.
Ratchet encryption evolves keys per chunk, ensuring forward security—if one shard is compromised, others remain protected.
4. Use Cases
Ransomware Recovery in Data Lakes: Immutable .sg1 blueprints regenerate encrypted data offline, with partial shards reconstructing via parity. Cross-graph recovery pulls from sibling objects, bypassing ransom demands.
Secure Transfers: Replace ZIP for finance/patient files; ratcheted shards and policies ensure compliance (GDPR/HIPAA).
Distributed Systems: Enhance torrents/game downloads with deduplicated, verifiable shards—regenerate lost parts from peers.
Forensics/Legal: Tamper-evident graphs for evidence chains; time-locked access for audits.
Disaster Recovery: Entropy-aware backups across hybrid environments, self-healing from drift or loss.
5. Why It’s Different
Traditional
Sigil + Regent
SHA256 hashes
Entropy + chaos residuals + Merkle trees
Full-file encryption
Post-quantum ratcheted shards
Rsync diffs
Cross-graph deduplication with Fibonacci residuals
Filesystem ACLs
Portable, contextual manifests (time/place/manner)
Backups
Self-healing, regenerative blueprints
ZIP archives
ZK proofs + quantum-safe signatures + partial regen
Sigil's math-driven approach (π anchoring, vector creation) turns data into a living system, resilient to attacks like ransomware.

7. Conclusion
Sigil Protocol transforms data from static vulnerabilities into dynamic, self-healing entities. By fusing open-source Rust with mathematical elegance (chaos, Fibonacci, constants), it offers a groundbreaking defense against ransomware in data lakes—regenerating from blueprints, enforcing secure access, and verifying integrity offline. Under AGPL-3.0, Sigil fosters collaborative innovation, empowering users to reclaim data sovereignty.
